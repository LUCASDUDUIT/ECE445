  possible materials for dog feeder:
  (1) Sheetmetal container formed into a box/silo that holds 50-60 lbs of dog food 
        (can be ordered through service shop for free)
  (2) The reciprocal is sheltered and protected by a hinged and motor driven lid.

· (3) LCD screen and botton/encoder for user to unit communication

. (4) infared sensor for food control in reciprocal

· (5) Servo motor dynamic loads

· (6) Stepper motor for holding torque

· (7) Grove - 125KHz RFID Reader

· (8) two resistors

  rubric for proposal and things we should change
 -  try to make high level requirements more testable.
    - specifu how far the rfid has to be for reciprical to open 
    - specify which rfid to use, bandwidth

- be quantitative with how much food is dispensed
- depending on how much the battery is at currently, when does the solar power begin to charge the batter?

block diagram
- specify pins thats used on micro controller
- reciprocal should be under food container 
- what solar panel is being used? and how much energy is being dispensed
- what communication is being used (bluetooth, wifi)
- specify voltage on arrows

subsystems
- be specific on requirements, mentioning measurements, 
- the motor will be running based on time, how much food should be dispensed by that time?
